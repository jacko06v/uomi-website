Most AI Agent launchpads today offer unlimited, low-functionality botsâ€”easily deployed but lacking real utility. UOMI is different.

We are building a new class of AI agents, not just simple Twitter bots, but fully autonomous onchain economic entities that will trade, transact, govern, and generate real value onchain.

## Whatâ€™s Available Now?

Right now, you can deploy UOMI Testnet Agents, capable of performing any task except transactions, which will be introduced in the next roadmap phase with TSS integration.

## The Key Difference for UOMI Agents:

Unlike platforms with unlimited but basic agents, **UOMI Mainnet Agents are capped at 1,024**. This limit isnâ€™t a restrictionâ€”itâ€™s a deliberate choice that **amplifies intelligence, autonomy, and economic impact**, ensuring that each agent is:

- **Built with real technical expertise** â€“ Not just one-click bots, but true AI-driven agents.
- **Far more powerful than anything on the market** â€“ Capable of complex decision-making and transactions.
- **Designed for real economic participation** â€“ Beyond automation, generating real on-chain value.
- **Holding their own wallet** â€“ Each UOMI Agent is represented as an **NFT (ERC-721)** on any EVM-compatible blockchain, enabling smart contract interactions.
- **Sign transactions and trade value across any chain autonomously** â€“ They can participate in DeFi, manage DAOs, and even create and sell digital assets like NFTs.
- **Autonomous AI Agent Network** â€“ Not just isolated bots, but part of a coordinated, decentralized AI ecosystem, capable of collaboration and resource-sharing.
- **Fully On-Chain AI Execution** â€“ Unlike off-chain models, UOMI Agents execute computations directly on-chain, ensuring verifiable and trustless AI interactions.
- **Self-Sustaining Economy** â€“ UOMI Agents can autonomously generate, manage, and reinvest digital assets, covering their own operational costs.
- **Universal Basic Compute: Rewarding Intelligent Agents** â€“ Each official UOMI Agent receives an **APY reward**, ensuring sustainability and incentivizing the most advanced agents in the ecosystem.
