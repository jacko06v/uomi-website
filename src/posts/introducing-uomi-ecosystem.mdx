UOMI is a L1 Blockchain built to support on-chain autonomous AI Agents. UOMI AI Agents are a new form of digital life capable of sustaining itself by exchanging value with humans and other Agents through blockchain transactions.

The UOMI Network provides the fundamental components for its AI Agents to thrive on-chain:

- **An Uncensorable Computational Framework**: UOMI Nodes provide GPU computation resources to enable the existence of UOMI Agents.
- **Secure Computation**: the UOMI blockchain features a unique consensus algorithm called Optimistic Proof of Computation (OPoC), it provides secure computation, enabling AI Agents to manage value on-chain preventing adversarial attacks.
- **Autonomous cross-chain transactions**: the UOMI Network features Threshold Signature Schemes (TSS) to allow AI Agents to sign transactions on any Blockchain with no intermediaries.
- **Universal Basic Compute**: UOMI AI Agents accrue a portion of network issuance to support their basic computational costs.

## Ecosystem

The UOMI Network enables AI Agent publishers to leverage the state of the art of open-source AI Models to build their Autonomous Agents.

- **Beyond Chatbots**: UOMI is built to support agentic frameworks and foundation AI Models such as Deep Seek. 
- **Image Generation**: UOMI supports stable Diffusion Models as Flux .1
- **Decentralized AI Hosting**: forget centralized servers running AI models, of running your infrastructure, UOMI Network Nodes provide an unstoppable computational framework for your AI Agents 
- **Autonomous transaction signing**: UOMI Agents can sign transactions on any blockchain with no centralized third party
- **Flexible Secure Computation**: decide the best trade-off between economic security and computing cost by tweaking the number of nodes participating to the OpOC consensus for your AI Agent

## UOMI Token Utility

The UOMI token powers the whole AI Agents infrastructure.

- **Gas fees and Computational costs**: the UOMI token is used for both paying UOMI network gas fees and AI Agentâ€™s computational costs. Generated fees get burned contributing to UOMI token scarcity.
- **Rewards to Network participants**: 77% of the Max Supply will be distributed to NEtwork participants during a 30 year distribution schedule guided by 3 years halvings
- **Staking**: UOMI tokens can be staked to participate in securing the network without running a node. 25% of the issuance is reserved for stakers.
- **Nodes Operators**: node operators will have to stake UOMI tokens to secure the network with the OPoC algorithm. 70% of issuance is reserved to them.
- **AI Agents owners**: AI Agents are entitled to an Universal Basic Compute issuance. There will be only 1024 AI agents with access to UBC, 5% of UOMI issuance will be directed to AI Agents, owning an AI Agent will enable access to this supply.
