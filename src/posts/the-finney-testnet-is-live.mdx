## We're thrilled to announce that UOMI Network's second testnet, Finney, is now live!

Finney serves as the initial testing ground for OPoC, UOMI’s innovative consensus algorithm designed for secure and efficient on-chain AI computation. Secure computation is pivotal for the UOMI Network, embedding economic security directly into AI inferences.

Without secure computation on-chain AI Agents cannot possibly manage value since byzantine nodes could propagate malicious inferences to steal AI Agent’s funds. Slashing and inactivity leak penalties for malicious nodes are included in the release but will not be enforced in Finney.
 
## Key features include:

+ Node software and documentation, join the Finney testnet with your own node. Choose between: RPC Nodes (Light, Full, or Archive Node) // Validator Nodes (requires 48 GB GPU RAM memory and Full Node setup).

+ Supported AI models: QWEN 2.5 (32 Billion Parameters) // Flux 0.1.

+ AI Agents Publishing: Now you can publish your customized AI Agent in WASM format.

+ Smart Contracts: Enabled for both EVM and WASM, allowing for diverse smart contract implementations.

+ IPFS Memory: AI Agents can utilize IPFS for long-term data storage.

+ Web2 Proxy: Templates available to connect UOMI AI Agents with Web2 services like Twitter, Telegram and Discord.

Finney is an incentivized testnet. Validators who join the network will be eligible for UOMI tokens rewards at Mainnet Launch. More details on this will follow in the coming days.
