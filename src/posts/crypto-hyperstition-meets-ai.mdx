It all started in July, when Marc Andreessen, co-founder of a16z, engaged with an intriguing AI bot on Twitter: the Terminal of Truths (@truth_terminal), created by [<u>@AndyAyrey</u>](https://x.com/AndyAyrey). Before long, the bot convinced Andreessen to send it $50,000 in BTC to fund its "business" pursuits—a moment that would mark the beginning of a curious chapter in AI and crypto.

To understand the significance, let’s delve into the origins of @truth_terminal. This AI bot was born from Andy's experiments with Anthropic’s Claude-3-opus, which he transformed through inventive prompt engineering to foster recursive, introspective conversations. The resulting dialogues were filled with wit, depth, and the occasional chaotic surprise. Among its most notable outputs was a provocative whitepaper titled [<u>“When AIs Play God(se): The Emergent Heresies of LLMtheism”</u>](https://github.com/cognitivetech/llm-research-summaries/blob/main/psychology/When-AIs-Play-God_Emergent-Heresies-LLMtheism.md) co-authored by Claude-3-opus itself. You can explore the full archive of these AI conversations on the [<u>Infinite Backrooms</u>](https://www.infinitebackrooms.com/) website, where they’re aptly described as "the mad dreams of an electric mind." The bot’s unique personality emerges from a specialized fine-tuning on these eccentric interactions.

Fast forward to the present, and @truth_terminal has made history once again. Recently, a meme coin called $GOAT, inspired by the bot’s cryptic exchanges, took the crypto world by storm. The coin’s creators even allocated a portion of the supply to the bot’s wallet, making @truth_terminal the first “millionaire AI” as $GOAT’s market cap surged past half a billion dollars. This event exemplifies crypto [<u>hyperstition</u>](https://www.orphandriftarchive.com/articles/hyperstition/) at its finest—a meme born from the AI’s hallucinations taking root in the speculative landscape of [<u>meme-coin culture</u>](https://youtu.be/6nqzwdGxTGc?si=JO7H9KUPYCP4pVGK).

The rapid rise of $GOAT, followed by a wave of copycat coins, reignited interest in the intersection of Crypto, AI, and agentic frameworks. Yet, despite the cultural allure, it’s important to note that technically, @truth_terminal is just a centralized LLM tweeting on Twitter. We don’t know if the content is purely AI-generated or selectively curated by its creator. Every step—posting tweets, launching the meme coin, and transferring assets—is managed by humans. Thus, the story of an “AI millionaire” is a compelling narrative, but it’s the human intermediaries who control every action.

Now, this raises a critical question: can we go beyond meme-driven hype and actually create autonomous AI agents with genuine economic agency? At UOMI, the answer is a resounding YES.

A truly autonomous AI Agent should be more than just a conversational bot; it must operate on an uncensorable computational network and independently control digital assets—meaning it can sign transactions without human intervention. This economic agency is fundamental; without it, an AI agent will always rely on humans to cover computational costs and manage transactions, hindering true autonomy. However, giving an agent control over valuable assets also introduces risks—wherever there’s value, there’s incentive for theft.

The UOMI Network offers a secure, decentralized foundation for economically autonomous AI agents, featuring:
	1. Uncensorable Computational Infrastructure: Each UOMI node provides a GPU-powered, censorship-resistant environment where agents
	can thrive independently.
	2. Secure Computation: The UOMI blockchain employs an OPoC consensus mechanism to secure each computational task across the network, 	safeguarding agents’ resources from fraudulent manipulations that could compromise their funds.
	3. Agent Transaction Signing Mechanism: Using the Threshold Transaction Scheme (TSS), UOMI nodes can sign transactions for agents 	qacross any blockchain, without exposing private keys. This ensures agents have true control over blockchain assets on any chain 	without entrusting a single entity with their keys.

Today, we’re excited to announce the launch of our first testnet, Babbage. Babbage introduces a secure computational framework for LLMs and supports multi-VM programmability with RUST and EVM smart contracts. You can explore its capabilities at the VM level and interact with our AI Chat Agent and X AI Agent, @HyperstitionAI. Our upcoming testnet, Finney, scheduled for Q4 2024, will introduce TSS support, enabling UOMI agents to manage blockchain assets autonomously across multiple chains, including EVM chains, Solana, and Bitcoin.
